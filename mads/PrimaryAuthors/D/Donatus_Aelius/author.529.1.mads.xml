    was a celebrated grammarian and rhetorician who taught at Rome in the middle of the fourth century, and was the

  <mads:note type="source">Brill's New Pauly: "Aelius D. Latin grammarian 4th cent. AD, Latin grammarian, perhaps
    born around 310 in Africa, teacher of Hieronymus in Rome. He composed an Ars grammatica (edition: [1
    4]) and commented on Virgil and Terence. An introduction in dialogue format preceded the Ars, which was
    written according to the rules of the art. It is dedicated to the partes orationis, which are introduced 
    in abbreviated form. The work was a synthesis of everything produced so far by grammarians and became one
    of the fundamental texts of grammatical teaching. It was soon commented upon by Servius and was distributed 
    throughout the Latin world. Between late antiquity and the Middle Ages a division occurred in manuscript 
    transmission between the Ars minor, the introduction, which was used as an elementary grammar, and the
    Ars maior. The latter was very famous throughout the entire Middle Ages and was commented upon in its
    entirety by Ercambertus of Freising and Remigius of Auxerre.... The commentary on the works of Virgil, 
    the original version of which is lost, is one of the most important exegetical works of late antiquity.
    However, it was frequently replaced by Servius' more manageable commentary. Of D.'s original only the
    dedication letter, Virgil's vita (edition: [2. 1-11]) and two introductions [2. 11-19] are preserved..
    .The commentary on Terence (edition: [3]) is preceded by a vita taken from Suetonius and an introduction to 
    the genre of comedy. However, the commentary on the Heauton Timoroumenos is lost. Eugraphius and the Scholia 
    Bembina, as well as Priscianus and Isidore refer to D.'s text.." Gatti, Paolo (Trient). "Donatus." Brill's
