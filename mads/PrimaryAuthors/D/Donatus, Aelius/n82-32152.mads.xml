  <mads:note type="source">Brill's New Pauly: "Aelius D. Latin grammarian 4th cent. AD, Latin
      grammarian, perhaps born around 310 in Africa, teacher of Hieronymus in Rome. He composed an
      Ars grammatica ... and commented on Virgil and Terence. An introduction in
      dialogue format preceded the Ars, which was written according to the rules of the art. It is
      dedicated to the partes orationis, which are introduced in abbreviated form. The work was a
      synthesis of everything produced so far by grammarians and became one of the fundamental texts
      of grammatical teaching. It was soon commented upon by Servius and was distributed throughout
      the Latin world. Between late antiquity and the Middle Ages a division occurred in manuscript
      transmission between the Ars minor, the introduction, which was used as an elementary grammar,
      and the Ars maior. The latter was very famous throughout the entire Middle Ages and was
      commented upon in its entirety by Ercambertus of Freising and Remigius of Auxerre.... The
      commentary on the works of Virgil, the original version of which is lost, is one of the most
      important exegetical works of late antiquity. However, it was frequently replaced by Servius'
      more manageable commentary. Of D.'s original only the dedication letter, Virgil's vita
      (edition: [2. 1-11]) and two introductions [2. 11-19] are preserved...The commentary on
      Terence (edition: [3]) is preceded by a vita taken from Suetonius and an introduction to the
      genre of comedy. However, the commentary on the Heauton Timoroumenos is lost. Eugraphius and
      the Scholia Bembina, as well as Priscianus and Isidore refer to D.'s text.." Gatti, Paolo
