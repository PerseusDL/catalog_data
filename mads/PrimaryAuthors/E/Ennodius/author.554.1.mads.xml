    "Ennodius, Magnus Felix, was born at Arles about A.D. 476, of a very illustrious family....His labours in 
    the service of the Church were so conspicuous that he was chosen bishop of Pavia...The writings of Ennodius
    might serve as an exemplification of all the worst faults of a corrupt style. ..."</mads:note>
  <mads:note type="source">Brill's New Pauly: "Born in AD 473-74, probably in Arles, derived from Gaulish 
    aristocracy. Raised in Pavia according to his rank, he entered into the service of the Church in 493 
    and became bishop of Pavia in 513. In 515 and 517, he was in Constantinople on behalf of Pope
    Hormisdas for the settlement of the Acacian schism and died in 521 (epitaph CIL VI 16464). His c.
    500 writings, among them 297 letters in the manner of Symmachus, were written before his tenure
    as bishop and were preserved in the manuscripts in approximately chronological order. Their
    affected and therefore often difficult to understand language is in keeping with the style
    cultivated by the Roman nobility under Theoderic..... the occasional poems in various metres
    show similar style, but hardly any poetic talent. The 151 epigrams are mostly descriptions or epitaphs.
    Attached to the ancient culture and full of admiration for the political and literary traditions of the Romans,
    E. clearly sees the decline of the old world power...under Theoderic
    however, he feels attached to Theoderic's cultural policy. He believes the artes liberales to be 
    indispensible for the education of young clerics and therefore emphasizes not only their
    intellectual value, but also their ethical value...." Gruber, Joachim (MÃ¼nchen). "Ennodius, Magnus Felix." Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider . Brill, 2009. Brill Online. Tufts University Library. 29 October 2009</mads:note>
