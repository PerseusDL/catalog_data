  <mads:note type="source">Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, Vol 2,
        1867, p. 19: "Ennodius, Magnus Felix, was born at Arles about A.D. 476, of a very
        illustrious family....His labours in the service of the Church were so conspicuous that he
        was chosen bishop of Pavia...The writings of Ennodius might serve as an exemplification of
        all the worst faults of a corrupt style. ..."</mads:note>
  <mads:note type="source">Brill's New Pauly: "Born in AD 473-74, probably in Arles, derived from
        Gaulish aristocracy. Raised in Pavia according to his rank, he entered into the service of
        the Church in 493 and became bishop of Pavia in 513. In 515 and 517, he was in
        Constantinople on behalf of Pope Hormisdas for the settlement of the Acacian schism and died
        in 521 (epitaph CIL VI 16464). His c. 500 writings, among them 297 letters in the manner of
        Symmachus, were written before his tenure as bishop and were preserved in the manuscripts in
        approximately chronological order. Their affected and therefore often difficult to
        understand language is in keeping with the style cultivated by the Roman nobility under
        Theoderic..... the occasional poems in various metres show similar style, but hardly any
        poetic talent. The 151 epigrams are mostly descriptions or epitaphs. Attached to the ancient
        culture and full of admiration for the political and literary traditions of the Romans, E.
        clearly sees the decline of the old world power...under Theoderic; however, he feels
        attached to Theoderic's cultural policy. He believes the artes liberales to be indispensible
        for the education of young clerics and therefore emphasizes not only their intellectual
        value, but also their ethical value...." Gruber, Joachim (M&#xFC;nchen). "Ennodius, Magnus
